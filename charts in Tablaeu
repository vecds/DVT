charts in Tableau
Tableau offers a wide range of charts and different visualizations to help users explore and present the data effectively. 
Some of the charts in Tableau are:

Bar Chart: They can be used to compare values between categories or to demonstrate the distribution of data across categories. 
  They help compare categorical data.

Line Chart: For displaying patterns and changes over time, line charts work incredibly well. To show how a single metric evolves, 
  they are frequently used with time series data.

Area Chart: They are identical to line charts, however with an area chart, the area beneath the line is coloured. 
To highlight the contrasts between the variables, they are utilized with various multiple variables in the data.

Pie Chart: It displays pieces of an entire. They help demonstrate how data is distributed when each category represents 
a certain percentage of the total.

Tree Maps: They use layered rectangles to display hierarchical data. They are useful for illuminating hierarchical 
  structures such as those found in files or organizational directories.

Bubble chart: Bubble charts are useful for comparing and visualizing data points with three separate properties. 
They are in use when you want to highlight data clusters, demonstrate relationships, etc.

Scatter Plot: They are used to show how two continuous variables relate to one another. 
  They aid in the data's discovery of correlations, clusters or outliers.

Density Map: The distribution and concentration of data points or values within a 2D space are depicted using density maps.

Heat Map: Data is displayed on a grid using heat maps, where colour denotes value. They can be used to visualize big datasets and spot patterns.

Symbol Map: By adding symbols or markers to a map to indicate information about particular locations, symbol maps are used to portray geographic data.

Gannt Chart: To visualize tasks, their durations and dependencies over time, Gannt charts are used in project management.

Bullet Graph: They are used to monitor advancement toward a goal. They offer a convenient method of showing a measure, a target and performance ranges.

Box Plot(Box and Whisker): They are employed to show the data's distribution and spot outliers. The median, quartiles and possible outliers are displayed.
