3. Financial analysis using Clustering, Histogram and HeatMap Program.

Financial analysis helps in understanding income, savings, and loan patterns of customers. 
R programming provides effective tools for analyzing and visualizing financial data. Histogram, 
clustering, and heatmap techniques are used to analyze bank customer financial data.


1. Data Collection and Preparation:
Data preparation is an important step before performing financial analysis. In this step, raw data 
is created, cleaned, and converted into a suitable format for analysis.

First, a data frame is created in R to store the financial details of bank customers such as income, 
savings, and loan amount.


2. Clustering:
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group data objects with similar characteristics.
K-Means clustering divides the dataset into K groups based on similarity.

In this analysis, K-Means is used to group bank customers based on income, savings, and loan amount.
Before applying K-Means, the data is scaled so that all variables have equal importance.

3. Histogram:
A histogram is a graphical representation used to show the distribution of numerical data. It divides
the data into intervals (bins) and displays the frequency of values in each interval using bars.

In this financial analysis, a histogram is used to analyze the distribution of customer income.
Use the hist() function in R to create histograms.
Adjust parameters like bin size to get a clean understanding of the distribution.

4.Heatmap:
A heatmap is a data visualization technique that represents values using different colors. It helps in 
easily identifying patterns, relationships, and variations in large datasets.

In this analysis, a heatmap is used to visualize the financial data of customers such as income, savings, 
and loan amount.
Use the heatmap() function in R to create a heatmap of the correlation matrix.
Adjust parameters like color scale and labels to enhance interpretability.

Step 1: Data Preparation
# Create customer financial data
financial_data <- data.frame(
  Income = c(6, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12),
  Savings = c(2.5, 3.0, 1.5, 4.5, 2.0, 5.0),
  Loan = c(1.2, 2.0, 0.8, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0)
)

row.names(financial_data) <- c("C1","C2","C3","C4","C5","C6")

print(financial_data)


#Step 2: Histogram

Histogram is used to analyze the distribution of customer income.


hist(financial_data$Income,
     col = "lightgreen",
     border = "black",
     main = "Histogram of Customer Income",
     xlab = "Annual Income (₹ Lakhs)")

Most customers fall in the middle-income group

A few high-income customers create right-side skewness

#Step 3:Clustering Analysis (K-Means)

# Scale the data
scaled_data <- scale(financial_data)

# Apply K-means clustering
set.seed(123)
kmeans_result <- kmeans(scaled_data, centers = 2)

# Cluster assignment
kmeans_result$cluster

#Cluster Visualization:

plot(scaled_data[,1], scaled_data[,2],
     col = kmeans_result$cluster,
     pch = 19,
     xlab = "Income (Scaled)",
     ylab = "Savings (Scaled)",
     main = "Customer Segmentation Using K-Means")

One cluster represents high-income, high-savings customers

The other cluster represents low to middle-income customers

Useful for targeted banking services

#Step 4: Heatmap
Heatmap shows the financial behavior patterns of customers.

heatmap(as.matrix(financial_data),
        col = heat.colors(256),
        scale = "column",
        main = "Heatmap of Customer Financial Data")

Darker colors indicate higher values
High-income customers show higher savings and loan amounts
Clear financial patterns across customers are visible

#Results and Discussion

Histogram revealed income distribution and customer diversity
Clustering divided customers into meaningful financial segments
Heatmap provided a visual summary of customer financial strength
This analysis can help banks in loan approval, risk assessment, and customer targeting.
