1. Acquiring and plotting data.
Acquiring and plotting data in R involves several steps, depending on the data source and the specific visualization requirements. Here's a basic example of how to acquire data from a CSV file and plot it using R
1.Acquiring Data: Suppose you have a CSV file named "data.csv" containing two columns: "x" and "y".
//Load the data from
CSV data read.csv("data.csv") #Check the structure of the dita str(data)
2. Plotting Data: Once you have loaded the data, you can use various plotting functions available in R to visualize it. Here's how you can create a simple scatter plot:
#Plotting a scatter plot
plot(data$x, data$y, main "Scatter Plot", xlab "X-axis label", ylab "Y-axis label", col "blue", pch =16)
This will create a scatter plot with blue points, where "x" values are plotted on the s-axis and "y" values are plotted on the y-axis.
3. Customizing the Plot: You can customize the plot further by adding titles, labels, legends, changing colors, adjusting axis limits, etc., according to your requirements.
#Customizing the plot
plot(data$x, data$y, main "Customized Scatter Plot", xlab "X-axis label", ylab = "Y-axis label", col="red", pch = 20)
This code will create a scatter plot with red points and different plotting characters.
4.Saving the Plot: Once you are satisfied with your plot, you can save it to a file using the pdf(), png(). jpeg().svg() functions. For example, to save the plot as a PDF file:
#Save the plot as a PDF file
pdf("scatter plot.pdf) plot(data$x, data$y, main ="Scatter Plot" , xlab = "X-axis label", ylab = "Y-axis label") dev.off() #Close the PDF device
This will save the plot as "scatter plot, pdf in your working directory.
