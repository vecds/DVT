2. What do you understand by Business Intelligence?
Business Intelligence is a method that utilizes technology for data analysis and information delivery to leaders, managers and employees 
in making strategic business decisions. As part of the BI process, organizations gather data from internal IT systems and external sources,
prepare it for analysis, run queries against the data, create data visualizations, 
BI dashboards and reports and then make the analytics results for making decision related to operations and strategic planning.

4. What are the different data types in Tableau?
Tableau supports 7 various different data types:

String
Numerical values
Date and time values
Boolean values
Geographic values
Date values
Cluster Values

What is the difference between Measures and Dimensions in Tableau?
Dimension: Dimensions are categorical fields that segment and describe data such as names, dates or categories.
Measure: Measures are numerical fields that can be aggregated to perform calculations like sum, average or count.\

What data sources we can connect with Tableau?
Databases
Cloud Storage Services
Web Connectors
Statistical and Analytics software
Data Servers and OLAP cubes
Excel and Text files

What are the different types of joins available in Tableau?
There are different types of joins in Tableau:

Inner Join: An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. 
          Rows that do not have a match in the other table are excluded from the result.
Left Join: A left join returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows present in the right table.
        If there is no match in the right table, null values are included in the result.
Right Join: A right join returns all the rows from the right table and matching rows present in the left table. 
        If there is no match in the left table, null values are included.
Full Outer Join: A full outer join returns all the rows where there is a match in either the left or right table.
        It includes all the rows from both tables and fills in null values where there is no match.

What is a calculated field 
A calculated field in Tableau is a user-defined field created by applying a formula or calculation to existing fields in your dataset. 
It can involve mathematical, string, logical or date operations to generate new insights, measurements or aggregations that are not
available in the original data. Calculated fields are useful for deriving custom metrics, creating new dimensions or modifying existing data,
giving you more flexibility in analysis and visualization. They can be used across worksheets, dashboards and reports.

What are the different data aggregation functions in Tableau?
Tableau has many different data aggregation functions used in Tableau:
SUM: AVG: MIN: MAX: COUNT: 

 What is a dual-axis plot and how we can create it in Tableau?
A dual-axis plot in Tableau is a visualization that displays two measures on the same chart using two separate y-axes,
  making it easier to compare metrics with different scales or units. This type of chart provides a clearer view of 
  relationships and trends between multiple measures in a single visualization.


What is a Dashboard in Tableau?
A dashboard in Tableau is a collection of multiple visualizations (worksheets), 
text, images and interactive elements combined in a single view. It is used to 
present different aspects of data together, allowing users to compare, monitor and interact with insights at once.

Instead of looking at charts separately, a dashboard brings them together for storytelling and decision-making.

Combines multiple views: You can place bar charts, maps, line charts and tables in one place.
Interactive controls: Filters, parameters and actions like highlight or go-to URL make dashboards dynamic.
Real-time updates: Refreshes automatically when the underlying data source updates.
Device-specific layouts: Can be optimized for desktop, tablet or mobile.
Storytelling: Lets you connect multiple charts into a meaningful narrative for business insights.
